There is a request smuggling vulnerability in async-h1 before version 2.3.0. This vulnerability affects any webserver that uses async-h1 behind a reverse proxy, including all such Tide applications. If the server does not read the body of a request which is longer than some buffer length, async-h1 will attempt to read a subsequent request from the body content starting at that offset into the body. One way to exploit this vulnerability would be for an adversary to craft a request such that the body contains a request that would not be noticed by a reverse proxy, allowing it to forge forwarded/x-forwarded headers. If an application trusted the authenticity of these headers, it could be misled by the smuggled request. Another potential concern with this vulnerability is that if a reverse proxy is sending multiple http clients&#x27; requests along the same keep-alive connection, it would be possible for the smuggled request to specify a long content and capture another user&#x27;s request in its body. This content could be captured in a post request to an endpoint that allows the content to be subsequently retrieved by the adversary.

Xenstored and guests communicate via a shared memory page using a specific protocol. When a guest violates this protocol, xenstored will drop the connection to that guest. Unfortunately, this is done by just removing the guest from xenstored&#x27;s internal management, resulting in the same actions as if the guest had been destroyed, including sending an @releaseDomain event. @releaseDomain events do not say that the guest has been removed. All watchers of this event must look at the states of all guests to find the guest that has been removed. When an @releaseDomain is generated due to a domain xenstored protocol violation, because the guest is still running, the watchers will not react. Later, when the guest is actually destroyed, xenstored will no longer have it stored in its internal data base, so no further @releaseDomain event will be sent. This can lead to a zombie domain; memory mappings of that guest&#x27;s memory will not be removed, due to the missing event. This zombie domain will be cleaned up only after another domain is destroyed, as that will trigger another @releaseDomain event. If the device model of the guest that violated the Xenstore protocol is running in a stub-domain, a use-after-free case could happen in xenstored, after having removed the guest from its internal data base, possibly resulting in a crash of xenstored. A malicious guest can block resources of the host for a period after its own death. Guests with a stub domain device model can eventually crash xenstored, resulting in a more serious denial of service (the prevention of any further domain management operations). Only the C variant of Xenstore is affected; the Ocaml variant is not affected. Only HVM guests with a stubdom device model can cause a serious DoS.</td><td>6.5</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-29483" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-29483</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2020-28241</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word">libmaxminddb before 1.4.3 has a heap-based buffer over-read in dump_entry_data_list in maxminddb.c.</td><td>6.5</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28241" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28241</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2020-27724</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word">In BIG-IP APM versions 16.0.0-16.0.0.1, 15.1.0-15.1.0.4, 15.0.0-15.0.1.3, 14.1.0-14.1.3, 13.1.0-13.1.3.4, 12.1.0-12.1.5.2, and 11.6.1-11.6.5.2, on systems running more than one TMM instance, authenticated VPN users may consume excessive resources by sending specially-crafted malicious traffic over the tunnel.</td><td>6.5</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27724" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27724</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2020-27722</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word">In BIG-IP APM versions 15.0.0-15.0.1.3, 14.1.0-14.1.3, and 13.1.0-13.1.3.4, under certain conditions, the VDI plugin does not observe plugin flow-control protocol causing excessive resource consumption.</td><td>6.5</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27722" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27722</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2020-24578</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word">An issue was discovered on D-Link DSL-2888A devices with firmware prior to AU_2.31_V1.1.47ae55.

When a Xenstore watch fires, the xenstore client that registered the watch will receive a Xenstore message containing the path of the modified Xenstore entry that triggered the watch, and the tag that was specified when registering the watch. Any communication with xenstored is done via Xenstore messages, consisting of a message header and the payload. The payload length is limited to 4096 bytes. Any request to xenstored resulting in a response with a payload longer than 4096 bytes will result in an error. When registering a watch, the payload length limit applies to the combined length of the watched path and the specified tag. Because watches for a specific path are also triggered for all nodes below that path, the payload of a watch event message can be longer than the payload needed to register the watch. A malicious guest that registers a watch using a very large tag (i.e., with a registration operation payload length close to the 4096 byte limit) can cause the generation of watch events with a payload length larger than 4096 bytes, by writing to Xenstore entries below the watched path. This will result in an error condition in xenstored. This error can result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a crash of xenstored. A malicious guest administrator can cause xenstored to crash, leading to a denial of service. Following a xenstored crash, domains may continue to run, but management operations will be impossible. Only C xenstored is affected, oxenstored is not affected.</td><td>6</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-29484" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-29484</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2020-29482</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word">An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x.

Management tools must access paths in guests&#x27; namespaces, necessarily using absolute paths. oxenstored imposes a pathname limit that is applied solely to the relative or absolute path specified by the client. Therefore, a guest can create paths in its own namespace which are too long for management tools to access. Depending on the toolstack in use, a malicious guest administrator might cause some management tools and debugging operations to fail. For example, a guest administrator can cause &quot;xenstore-ls -r&quot; to fail. However, a guest administrator cannot prevent the host administrator from tearing down the domain.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL&#x27;s s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the &quot;-crl_download&quot; option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL&#x27;s parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

When this feature is enabled, a protected function writes a guard value to the stack prior to (above) any vulnerable arrays in the stack. The guard value is checked for corruption on function return; corruption leads to an error-handler call. In certain circumstances, the reference value that is compared against the guard value is itself also written to the stack (after any vulnerable arrays). The reference value is written to the stack when the function runs out of registers to use for other temporary data. If both the reference value and the guard value are written to the stack, then the stack protection will fail to spot corruption when both values are overwritten with the same value. For both the reference value and the guard value to be corrupted, there would need to be both a buffer overflow and a buffer underflow in the vulnerable arrays (or some other vulnerability that causes two separated stack entries to be corrupted).</td><td>&ndash;</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24658" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24658</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2020-24360</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word">An issue with ARP packets in Arista’s EOS affecting the 7800R3, 7500R3, and 7280R3 series of products may result in issues that cause a kernel crash, followed by a device reload.

Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID&#x27;s alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.</td><td>&ndash;</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11093" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11093</a></td></tr></table></div>

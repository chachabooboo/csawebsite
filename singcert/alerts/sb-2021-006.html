Http4s before versions 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14 have a vulnerability which can lead to a denial-of-service. Blaze-core, a library underlying http4s-blaze-server, accepts connections unboundedly on its selector pool. This has the net effect of amplifying degradation in services that are unable to handle their current request load, since incoming connections are still accepted and added to an unbounded queue. Each connection allocates a socket handle, which drains a scarce OS resource. This can also confound higher level circuit breakers which work based on detecting failed connections. http4s provides a general &quot;MaxActiveRequests&quot; middleware mechanism for limiting open connections, but it is enforced inside the Blaze accept loop, after the connection is accepted and the socket opened. Thus, the limit only prevents the number of connections which can be simultaneously processed, not the number of connections which can be held open. In 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14, a new &quot;maxConnections&quot; property, with a default value of 1024, has been added to the `BlazeServerBuilder`. Setting the value to a negative number restores unbounded behavior, but is strongly disrecommended. The NIO2 backend does not respect `maxConnections`. Its use is now deprecated in http4s-0.21, and the option is removed altogether starting in http4s-0.22.

All servers running blaze-core before version 0.14.15 are affected by a vulnerability in which unbounded connection acceptance leads to file handle exhaustion. Blaze, accepts connections unconditionally on a dedicated thread pool. This has the net effect of amplifying degradation in services that are unable to handle their current request load, since incoming connections are still accepted and added to an unbounded queue. Each connection allocates a socket handle, which drains a scarce OS resource. This can also confound higher level circuit breakers which work based on detecting failed connections. The vast majority of affected users are using it as part of http4s-blaze-server &lt;= 0.21.16. http4s provides a mechanism for limiting open connections, but is enforced inside the Blaze accept loop, after the connection is accepted and the socket opened. Thus, the limit only prevents the number of connections which can be simultaneously processed, not the number of connections which can be held open. The issue is fixed in version 0.14.15 for &quot;NIO1SocketServerGroup&quot;. A &quot;maxConnections&quot; parameter is added, with a default value of 512. Concurrent connections beyond this limit are rejected. To run unbounded, which is not recommended, set a negative number. The &quot;NIO2SocketServerGroup&quot; has no such setting and is now deprecated.

When receiving a request, Squid checks its cache to see if it can serve up a response. It does this by making a MD5 hash of the absolute URL of the request. If found, it servers the request. The absolute URL can include the decoded UserInfo &#40;username and password&#41; for certain protocols. This decoded info is prepended to the domain. This allows an attacker to provide a username that has special characters to delimit the domain, and treat the rest of the URL as a path or query string. An attacker could first make a request to their domain using an encoded username, then when a request for the target domain comes in that decodes to the exact URL, it will serve the attacker&#x27;s HTML instead of the real HTML. On Squid servers that also act as reverse proxies, this allows an attacker to gain access to features that only reverse proxies can use, such as ESI.</td><td>7.5</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12520" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12520</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2019-10923</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">A vulnerability has been identified in Development&#47;Evaluation Kits for PROFINET IO: DK Standard Ethernet Controller &#40;All versions &lt; V4.1.1 Patch 05&#41;, Development&#47;Evaluation Kits for PROFINET IO: EK-ERTEC 200 &#40;All versions &lt; V4.5.0 Patch 01&#41;, Development&#47;Evaluation Kits for PROFINET IO: EK-ERTEC 200P &#40;All versions &lt; V4.5.0&#41;, SCALANCE X-200IRT switch family &#40;incl.

Tendermint Core v0.34.0 introduced a new way of handling evidence of misbehavior. As part of this, we added a new Timestamp field to Evidence structs. This timestamp would be calculated using the same algorithm that is used when a block is created and proposed. &#40;This algorithm relies on the timestamp of the last commit from this specific block.&#41; In Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2, the consensus reactor is responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence whenever double signs are observed. However, the current block is still “in flight” when it is being formed by the consensus reactor. It hasn’t been finalized through network consensus yet. This means that different nodes in the network may observe different “last commits” when assigning a timestamp to DuplicateVoteEvidence. In turn, different nodes could form DuplicateVoteEvidence objects at the same height but with different timestamps. One DuplicateVoteEvidence object &#40;with one timestamp&#41; will then eventually get finalized in the block, but this means that any DuplicateVoteEvidence with a different timestamp is considered invalid. Any node that formed invalid DuplicateVoteEvidence will continue to propose invalid evidence; its peers may see this, and choose to disconnect from this node. This bug means that double signs are DoS vectors in Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2. Tendermint Core v0.34.3 is a security release which fixes this bug. As of v0.34.3, DuplicateVoteEvidence is no longer formed by the consensus reactor; rather, the consensus reactor passes the Votes themselves into the EvidencePool, which is now responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence. The EvidencePool has timestamp info that should be consistent across the network, which means that DuplicateVoteEvidence formed in this reactor should have consistent timestamps. This release changes the API between the consensus and evidence reactors.</td><td>6.5</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21271" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21271</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2021-1389</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">A vulnerability in the IPv6 traffic processing of Cisco IOS XR Software and Cisco NX-OS Software for certain Cisco devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass an IPv6 access control list &#40;ACL&#41; that is configured for an interface of an affected device.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1&#41; Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2&#41; When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name &#40;exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token&#41; If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL&#x27;s s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the &quot;-crl_download&quot; option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL&#x27;s parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i &#40;Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h&#41;.

In case the file was already present, they would follow symlinks if the file happened to be a symlink instead of a regular file. An additional chown of the file would then take place after it was written, making the user Unbound&#47;NSD is supposed to run as the new owner of the file. If an attacker has local access to the user Unbound&#47;NSD runs as, she could create a symlink in place of the PID file pointing to a file that she would like to erase.

On Unix like systems, the system&#x27;s temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability. This vulnerability impacts you if the JUnit tests write sensitive information, like API keys or passwords, into the temporary folder, and the JUnit tests execute in an environment where the OS has other untrusted users. Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are using. For Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in 4.13.1. For Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available, you must use the workaround below. If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix this vulnerability.

The &quot;Flarum Sticky&quot; extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust&#40;&#41; helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where --redacted--s an open source discussion platform for websites. The &quot;Flarum Sticky&quot; extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust&#40;&#41; helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where &lt;script&gt; tags would not be executed. However it was possible to run javascript from other HTML attributes, enabling a cross-site scripting &#40;XSS&#41; attack to be performed. Since the exploit only happens with the first post of a pinned discussion, an attacker would need the ability to pin their own discussion, or be able to edit a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned posts are authored by your staff, you can be relatively certain the vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum doesn&#x27;t store the post content history, you cannot be certain if a malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky extension. Forum administrators can disable the Sticky extension until they are able to apply the update.

In affected versions of Radar COVID, identification and de-anonymization of COVID-19 positive users that upload Radar COVID TEKs to the Radar COVID server is possible. This vulnerability enables the identification and de-anonymization of COVID-19 positive users when using Radar COVID. The vulnerability is caused by the fact that Radar COVID connections to the server &#40;uploading of TEKs to the backend&#41; are only made by COVID-19 positives. Therefore, any on-path observer with the ability to monitor traffic between the app and the server can identify which users had a positive test. Such an adversary can be the mobile network operator &#40;MNO&#41; if the connection is done through a mobile network, the Internet Service Provider &#40;ISP&#41; if the connection is done through the Internet &#40;e.g., a home network&#41;, a VPN provider used by the user, the local network operator in the case of enterprise networks, or any eavesdropper with access to the same network &#40;WiFi or Ethernet&#41; as the user as could be the case of public WiFi hotspots deployed at shopping centers, airports, hotels, and coffee shops. The attacker may also de-anonymize the user. For this additional stage to succeed, the adversary needs to correlate Radar COVID traffic to other identifiable information from the victim. This could be achieved by associating the connection to a contract with the name of the victim or by associating Radar COVID traffic to other user-generated flows containing identifiers in the clear &#40;e.g., HTTP cookies or other mobile flows sending unique identifiers like the IMEI or the AAID without encryption&#41;. The former can be executed, for instance, by the Internet Service Provider or the MNO. The latter can be executed by any on-path adversary, such as the network provider or even the cloud provider that hosts more than one service accessed by the victim. The farther the adversary is either from the victim &#40;the client&#41; or the end-point &#40;the server&#41;, the less likely it may be that the adversary has access to re-identification information. The vulnerability has been mitigated with the injection of dummy traffic from the application to the backend. Dummy traffic is generated by all users independently of whether they are COVID-19 positive or not. The issue was fixed in iOS in version 1.0.8 &#40;uniform distribution&#41;, 1.1.0 &#40;exponential distribution&#41;, Android in version 1.0.7 &#40;uniform distribution&#41;, 1.1.0 &#40;exponential distribution&#41;, Backend in version 1.1.2-RELEASE.

When receiving a query, dnsmasq does not check for an existing pending request for the same name and forwards a new request. By default, a maximum of 150 pending queries can be sent to upstream servers, so there can be at most 150 queries for the same name. This flaw allows an off-path attacker on the network to substantially reduce the number of attempts that it would have to perform to forge a reply and have it accepted by dnsmasq. This issue is mentioned in the &quot;Birthday Attacks&quot; section of RFC5452. If chained with CVE-2020-25684, the attack complexity of a successful attack is reduced.

Due to the weak hash &#40;CRC32 when dnsmasq is compiled without DNSSEC, SHA-1 when it is&#41; this flaw allows an off-path attacker to find several different domains all having the same hash, substantially reducing the number of attempts they would have to perform to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This is in contrast with RFC5452, which specifies that the query name is one of the attributes of a query that must be used to match a reply.

Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. In Helm from version 3.0 and before version 3.5.2, there a few cases where data loaded from potentially untrusted sources was not properly sanitized. When a SemVer in the `version` field of a chart is invalid, in some cases Helm allows the string to be used &quot;as is&quot; without sanitizing. Helm fails to properly sanitized some fields present on Helm repository `index.yaml` files. Helm does not properly sanitized some fields in the `plugin.yaml` file for plugins In some cases, Helm does not properly sanitize the fields in the `Chart.yaml` file. By exploiting these attack vectors, core maintainers were able to send deceptive information to a terminal screen running the `helm` command, as well as obscure or alter information on the screen. In some cases, we could send codes that terminals used to execute higher-order logic, like clearing a terminal screen. Further, during evaluation, the Helm maintainers discovered a few other fields that were not properly sanitized when read out of repository index files. This fix remedies all such cases, and once again enforces SemVer2 policies on version fields. All users of the Helm 3 should upgrade to the fixed version 3.5.2 or later. Those who use Helm as a library should verify that they either sanitize this data on their own, or use the proper Helm API calls to sanitize the data.</td><td>&ndash;</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21303" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21303</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2021-21290</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers &amp; clients. In Netty before version 4.1.59.Final there is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure temp file. When netty&#x27;s multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file&#47;directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method &quot;File.createTempFile&quot; on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions &quot;-rw-r--r--&quot;. Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty&#x27;s &quot;AbstractDiskHttpData&quot; is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own &quot;java.io.tmpdir&quot; when you start the JVM or use &quot;DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir&#40;...&#41;&quot; to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.</td><td>&ndash;</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21290" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21290</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2021-21288</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">CarrierWave is an open-source RubyGem which provides a simple and flexible way to upload files from Ruby applications.

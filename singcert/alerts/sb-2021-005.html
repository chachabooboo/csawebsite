When this happens, the ByteBuffer containing the HTTP response headers is released back to the ByteBufferPool twice. Because of this double release, two threads can acquire the same ByteBuffer from the pool and while thread1 is about to use the ByteBuffer to write response1 data, thread2 fills the ByteBuffer with other data. Thread1 then proceeds to write the buffer that now contains different data. This results in client1, which issued request1 seeing data from another request or response which could contain sensitive data belonging to client2 (HTTP session ids, authentication credentials, etc.).

A bug was discovered in the `flatpak-portal` service that can allow sandboxed applications to execute arbitrary code on the host system (a sandbox escape). This sandbox-escape bug is present in versions from 0.11.4 and before fixed versions 1.8.5 and 1.10.0. The Flatpak portal D-Bus service (`flatpak-portal`, also known by its D-Bus service name `org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak`) allows apps in a Flatpak sandbox to launch their own subprocesses in a new sandbox instance, either with the same security settings as the caller or with more restrictive security settings. For example, this is used in Flatpak-packaged web browsers such as Chromium to launch subprocesses that will process untrusted web content, and give those subprocesses a more restrictive sandbox than the browser itself. In vulnerable versions, the Flatpak portal service passes caller-specified environment variables to non-sandboxed processes on the host system, and in particular to the `flatpak run` command that is used to launch the new sandbox instance. A malicious or compromised Flatpak app could set environment variables that are trusted by the `flatpak run` command, and use them to execute arbitrary code that is not in a sandbox. As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by preventing the `flatpak-portal` service from starting, but that mitigation will prevent many Flatpak apps from working correctly. This is fixed in versions 1.8.5 and 1.10.0.</td><td>8.8</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21261" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21261</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2021-21116</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word">Heap buffer overflow in audio in Google Chrome prior to 87.0.4280.141 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.</td><td>8.8</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21116" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21116</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2021-21114</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word">Use after free in audio in Google Chrome prior to 87.0.4280.141 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.</td><td>8.8</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21114" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21114</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2021-21113</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word">Heap buffer overflow in Skia in Google Chrome prior to 87.0.4280.141 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.</td><td>8.8</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21113" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21113</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2021-21112</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word">Use after free in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 87.0.4280.141 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.</td><td>8.8</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21112" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21112</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2021-20621</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word">Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Aterm WG2600HP firmware Ver1.0.2 and earlier, and Aterm WG2600HP2 firmware Ver1.0.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators via unspecified vectors.</td><td>8.8</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20621" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20621</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2021-1303</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word">A vulnerability in the user management roles of Cisco DNA Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute unauthorized commands on an affected device.

Weave Net before version 2.8.0 has a vulnerability in which can allow an attacker to take over any host in the cluster. Weave Net is supplied with a manifest that runs pods on every node in a Kubernetes cluster, which are responsible for managing network connections for all other pods in the cluster. This requires a lot of power over the host, and the manifest sets `privileged: true`, which gives it that power. It also set `hostPID: true`, which gave it the ability to access all other processes on the host, and write anywhere in the root filesystem of the host. This setting was not necessary, and is being removed. You are only vulnerable if you have an additional vulnerability (e.g. a bug in Kubernetes) or misconfiguration that allows an attacker to run code inside the Weave Net pod, No such bug is known at the time of release, and there are no known instances of this being exploited. Weave Net 2.8.0 removes the hostPID setting and moves CNI plugin install to an init container. Users who do not update to 2.8.0 can edit the hostPID line in their existing DaemonSet manifest to say false instead of true, arrange some other way to install CNI plugins (e.g. Ansible) and remove those mounts from the DaemonSet manifest.</td><td>8</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26278" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26278</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2021-2129</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word">Vulnerability in the Oracle VM VirtualBox product of Oracle Virtualization (component: Core).

ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a &quot;zip-slip&quot; vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com&#47;deislabs&#47;oras&#47;pkg&#47;content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com&#47;deislabs&#47;oras&#47;pkg&#47;content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.</td><td>7.7</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21272" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21272</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2020-35749</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word">Directory traversal vulnerability in class-simple_job_board_resume_download_handler.php in the Simple Board Job plugin 2.9.3 and earlier for WordPress allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via the sjb_file parameter to wp-admin&#47;post.php.</td><td>7.7</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35749" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35749</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2020-6555</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word">Out of bounds read in WebGL in Google Chrome prior to 84.0.4147.125 allowed a remote attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via a crafted HTML page.</td><td>7.6</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6555" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6555</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2020-5361</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word">Select Dell Client Commercial and Consumer platforms support a BIOS password reset capability that is designed to assist authorized customers who forget their passwords.

These crafted packets, which should be discarded, are instead replicated and sent to the RE. Over time, a Denial of Service (DoS) occurs. Continued receipt of these crafted protocol packets will cause an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition, which may cause wider traffic impact due to protocol flapping. An indication of compromise is to check &quot;monitor interface traffic&quot; on the ingress and egress port packet counts. For each ingress packet, two duplicate packets are seen on egress.

If an attacker has local access to the user Unbound&#47;NSD runs as, she could create a symlink in place of the PID file pointing to a file that she would like to erase. If then Unbound&#47;NSD is killed and the PID file is not cleared, upon restarting with root privileges, Unbound&#47;NSD will rewrite any file pointed at by the symlink. This is a local vulnerability that could create a Denial of Service of the system Unbound&#47;NSD is running on. It requires an attacker having access to the limited permission user Unbound&#47;NSD runs as and point through the symlink to a critical file on the system.</td><td>5.5</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28935" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28935</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2020-27845</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word">There&#x27;s a flaw in src&#47;lib&#47;openjp2&#47;pi.c of openjpeg in versions prior to 2.4.0.

Http4s before versions 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14 have a vulnerability which can lead to a denial-of-service. Blaze-core, a library underlying http4s-blaze-server, accepts connections unboundedly on its selector pool. This has the net effect of amplifying degradation in services that are unable to handle their current request load, since incoming connections are still accepted and added to an unbounded queue. Each connection allocates a socket handle, which drains a scarce OS resource. This can also confound higher level circuit breakers which work based on detecting failed connections. http4s provides a general &quot;MaxActiveRequests&quot; middleware mechanism for limiting open connections, but it is enforced inside the Blaze accept loop, after the connection is accepted and the socket opened. Thus, the limit only prevents the number of connections which can be simultaneously processed, not the number of connections which can be held open. In 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14, a new &quot;maxConnections&quot; property, with a default value of 1024, has been added to the `BlazeServerBuilder`. Setting the value to a negative number restores unbounded behavior, but is strongly disrecommended. The NIO2 backend does not respect `maxConnections`.

All servers running blaze-core before version 0.14.15 are affected by a vulnerability in which unbounded connection acceptance leads to file handle exhaustion. Blaze, accepts connections unconditionally on a dedicated thread pool. This has the net effect of amplifying degradation in services that are unable to handle their current request load, since incoming connections are still accepted and added to an unbounded queue. Each connection allocates a socket handle, which drains a scarce OS resource. This can also confound higher level circuit breakers which work based on detecting failed connections. The vast majority of affected users are using it as part of http4s-blaze-server &lt;= 0.21.16. http4s provides a mechanism for limiting open connections, but is enforced inside the Blaze accept loop, after the connection is accepted and the socket opened. Thus, the limit only prevents the number of connections which can be simultaneously processed, not the number of connections which can be held open. The issue is fixed in version 0.14.15 for &quot;NIO1SocketServerGroup&quot;. A &quot;maxConnections&quot; parameter is added, with a default value of 512. Concurrent connections beyond this limit are rejected. To run unbounded, which is not recommended, set a negative number. The &quot;NIO2SocketServerGroup&quot; has no such setting and is now deprecated.

The &quot;Flarum Sticky&quot; extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust() helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where &lt;script&gt; tags would not be executed. However it was possible to run javascript from other HTML attributes, enabling a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to be performed. Since the exploit only happens with the first post of a pinned discussion, an attacker would need the ability to pin their own discussion, or be able to edit a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned posts are authored by your staff, you can be relatively certain the vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum doesn&#x27;t store the post content history, you cannot be certain if a malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky extension.

Tendermint Core v0.34.0 introduced a new way of handling evidence of misbehavior. As part of this, we added a new Timestamp field to Evidence structs. This timestamp would be calculated using the same algorithm that is used when a block is created and proposed. (This algorithm relies on the timestamp of the last commit from this specific block.) In Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2, the consensus reactor is responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence whenever double signs are observed. However, the current block is still “in flight” when it is being formed by the consensus reactor. It hasn’t been finalized through network consensus yet. This means that different nodes in the network may observe different “last commits” when assigning a timestamp to DuplicateVoteEvidence. In turn, different nodes could form DuplicateVoteEvidence objects at the same height but with different timestamps. One DuplicateVoteEvidence object (with one timestamp) will then eventually get finalized in the block, but this means that any DuplicateVoteEvidence with a different timestamp is considered invalid. Any node that formed invalid DuplicateVoteEvidence will continue to propose invalid evidence; its peers may see this, and choose to disconnect from this node. This bug means that double signs are DoS vectors in Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2. Tendermint Core v0.34.3 is a security release which fixes this bug. As of v0.34.3, DuplicateVoteEvidence is no longer formed by the consensus reactor; rather, the consensus reactor passes the Votes themselves into the EvidencePool, which is now responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence. The EvidencePool has timestamp info that should be consistent across the network, which means that DuplicateVoteEvidence formed in this reactor should have consistent timestamps. This release changes the API between the consensus and evidence reactors.</td><td>&ndash;</td><td style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21271" target="_blank">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21271</a></td></tr><tr><td>CVE-2021-21266</td><td style="word-wrap: break-word">openHAB is a vendor and technology agnostic open source automation software for your home.
